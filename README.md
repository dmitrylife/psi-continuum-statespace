# Psi–Continuum State-Space Diagnostics

This repository will host state-space diagnostic tools for the
Psi–Continuum cosmology framework.

The project provides a macroscopic state-space representation of
late-time cosmic expansion, constructed as a derived diagnostic
using the frozen Psi–Continuum v2 background API.

🚧 **Work in progress**

The initial public release, including source code, documentation,
and examples, will be added soon.
