# Psi–Continuum State-Space Diagnostics

This repository hosts diagnostic tools for the Psi–Continuum cosmology
framework, providing a macroscopic state-space representation of
late-time cosmic expansion.

The state-space construction is implemented as a derived diagnostic
based on a fixed background-level implementation,
consistent with Psi–Continuum Cosmology v2.

---

## Scope

This package implements **diagnostic state-space analysis only**.

It does not introduce new cosmological models, modify gravitational
dynamics, alter the Psi–Continuum v2 API, or perform parameter fitting.
All results are derived exclusively from background expansion histories
provided by the frozen v2 implementation.

The package is designed to support transparent and fully reproducible
state-space diagnostics at the background level.

---

## Current status

- Core state-space diagnostic framework implemented
- Interactive command-line interface available
- Reproducible numerical metrics and publication-ready figures supported

## Usage

The package provides a command-line interface for exploratory and
diagnostic use. All files generated by the CLI are runtime artefacts and
do not represent published results.

Example usage (interactive shell):

```bash
psi-statespace interactive
```
